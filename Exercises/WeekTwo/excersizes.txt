##Problem One:    

    In C/C++ a declartion means giving a variable a type and a name, like
                 int a;
    While defining something (like a variable) means to both declare and initlize, like
                int a = 3;

    What happens if you declare a reference variabe? like
                int& a;
    Explain the outcome. (Hint: There is no universal answer)


##Solution One:
    


##Problem Two: (Scope and namespaces)

    a) What is the outcome of the following program? 
            
            int a = 12;
            int main() {
                int a = 20;
                cout<<"a: "<<a<<endl;
            }

        Why? What happens here?

    b) What is the outcome of the following?
	void f(){
		int x = 12;
	}
	int main() {
		std::cout<<x;
	}

    b) What does "using namespace std" do? Why do we use it?

    c) Write and compile the following
        
        #include <iostream>

        using std::cout;
        int main(){
            cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
            return 0;   
        }
        Does it compile? Why? Why not?

##Problem Three: (Functions)

    a) Write and test a function that computes the square root of a number.
    b) Write a void function that calculates the area of a circle with radius and area as parameters.
    c) Write a function that computes the factorial of an integer.
    b) create a function called bar that prints out "bar!".
    c) Create a namespace called Foo
    d) In code, show 2 different ways of calling the bar function.
    e) 


##Problem Four: (Strings)

	a) Write a function that checks if the word "secret" is in a string
	a) Write a function that checks if a string is is a palindrome 
		(Hint: check if there is a library function that can help you)

##Extra:
       Try to write a function that computes the factorial recursively.
       Find the factorial of 100001 recursively, what happens? Why?
